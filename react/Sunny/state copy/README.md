# State

## What is state?

### In the real world?

- Properties of an object that reflects what it's doing "state of being"
- Example: H2O - water, ice, steam (state is changed by some external force)

### In React

- A kind of variable that exists within a component
  - Determines behaviour/rendering
  - Changed by user interaction

## State Vs Props

### Props

- Passed in by parent component
- Immutable - once props are passed they can't change
- A change in props causes a rerender

### State

- Exists within a component
- Can be changed
- A change in state will cause the component to rerender
