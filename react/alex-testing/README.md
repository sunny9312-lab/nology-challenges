# Testing

## Why do we test code?

- Check for bugs, make sure nothing is breaking or being weird.
- Make it ready for production, ready to be used by a user
- Confirm/validate our expectations or understanding of what the code does
- Provides certainty that code will do what it is supposed to
- Testing is also documentaiton
- Testing provides safety for making changes

  - Continous Integreation (CI/CD)

  ## How do we test in React?

  ### End To End options (not touching this now)

  - Cypress
  - Playwright
  - Selenium (big for pure testing roles)

  ### Component Testing

  ## What do we test?

  - Does it render?
  - Does it render the correct things?
  - Does it do what it's supposed to?
  - Does it respond to user actions?
